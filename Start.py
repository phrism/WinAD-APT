        WinAD-APT is for windows AD auto pentesting framework,
        this framework is made using streamlit and python, which is used to make windows AD exploit more easily. 
        The framework is still being developed, it is welcomed to commnicate and share some ideas.
        **ðŸ‘ˆ Select a demo from the sidebar** to start your windows AD hacking journey
        ### What can this framwork do?
        - Simple nmap function for entrence ip
        - Auto gather information and possible username and password of target
        - Auto LateralPenetration from one account to another
        - Auto Privilege Escalation
        ### How to use my framework?
        - Started by adding a targte ip in **this** page
        - Find the target domain using nmap and add it to **this** page
        - Other things you can just type in and click, the result will show to U after the command is complete
        - All your histoy command is in history page
        - [CAUTION] Do not refresh any page even if it went something wrong !!! It is no difference with rerun the whole app and U will lose everything
        ### First thing to do
        The first thing for pentesting a target â€”â€” is to set a target! U can set a target blow and start 
        your journey of pentesting:
